# Real Time Bus Tracker

<img src="Map.png" width='300'/>

Description:

In this exercise we use the Google Maps API to display the live location of buses on a map. We gathered real-time data of the Boston MBTA buses and added it to a Google Map. The bus location markers are updated every 15 seconds. The marker changes color to either blue or red depending on which direction it's going.

How to Run:

Simply drag the Index.html file directly from the directory folder. Then you can go fullscreen mode, zoom in or out, and change bewteen map or satellite.

Roadmap of future improvements:

I would like to make it so that the style of the map changes to dark mode when it it nightime, and back to light mode when it is day time. I would also like to add markers for each bus stop with their approximate arrival times.
